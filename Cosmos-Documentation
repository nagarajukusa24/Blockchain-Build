COSMOS:: Internet of Blockchains

Open Source Tools:: TinderMint, Cosmos SDK, IBC

Initially, No Intercommunication process between the Blockchains. Limited No. of TXNs per Second.

To build Custom, secure & interoperable Blockchains

TinderMint ==> Network+Consensus Packages are pre-built, enabling the applications systems to be built by the developers which will be executed using Etherium Virtual Machine

TinderMint Enginer is connected to a application by a socket programming called ABCI(Application Blockchain Interface)

To Build Application Layer for the Custom Blockchain, We need Cosmos SDK to build on top of TinderMint BFT Engine

COSMOS SDK::
	- Offers Code Modularity
	- Enhanced Security
	- We use this SDK as We Couldn't build ABCI from scratch jst for our custom blockchain(Saves Dev Efforts & Time).

In other words, Cosmos is an ecosystem of blockchains
Blockchain
A blockchain can be described as a distributed digital ledger maintained by a set of validators that remains correct even if some of the validators (less than a third) are malicious.

 that can scale and interoperate with each other. Before Cosmos, blockchains were siloed and unable to communicate with each other. They were hard to build and could only handle a small amount of transactions per second. Cosmos solves these problems with a new technical vision. In order to understand this vision we need to go back to the fundamentals of blockchain technology.


 At the time, there were two options to develop decentralized applications: either fork the bitcoin codebase or build on top of it. However, the bitcoin codebase was very monolithic; all three layers—networking, consensus and application — were mixed together. Additionally, the Bitcoin scripting language was limited and not user-friendly.


 Layers in Blockchain:
 	- Network
 	- Consensus
 	- Application
